/*Let's build a calculator.

This is very basic Javascript kata.

The test expects you to provide a Calculator object with the following methods:

Calculator.add()
Calculator.subtract()
Calculator.multiply()
Calculator.divide()
Each method expects two arguments, so for instance:

Calculator.add(1,4) should return 5.

Only integers are expected to be passed in as arguments, and the divide method should return 'false' when trying the divide by zero.*/

let Calculator = {
  add: (num1, num2) => num1 + num2,
  subtract: (num1, num2) => num1 - num2,
  multiply: (num1, num2) => num1 * num2,
  divide: (num1, num2) => num2 === 0 ? false : num1 / num2
};
