/*Write a function, inRange, which takes in three numbers: n, start, and end. It should return true/false if n is between start and up to,
but not including, end.

If end is not specified, itâ€™s set to start with start then set to 0.

If start is greater than end the params are swapped.*/

//if end is undefined,
	//set end to start
	//set start to 0
//if start is greater than end,
	//set start to end
	//set end to start
//if n is between start and up to end,
	//return true

function inRange(n, start, end) { // n = 1.2, start = 2
	if(end === undefined){
		end = start; // end = 2
		start = 0; // start = 0
